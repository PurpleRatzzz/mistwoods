  Hello there fellow text adventure game lovers!
  Welcome to Misty Forest!  -----Julia Zhu, creator.

# Introduction
You opened your eyes, finding yourself lying on a cold hard ground with ghostly mist in every direction. You have been kidnapped, and now they dumped you in this misty forest. You found a phone in your pocket. You turned on the phone to see a group chat interface that cannot be closed. In fact, you realized the only way you can communicate with the other people now was through the group chat. Who is also in the group chat? How can you get out of the forest? What do they want? And, did you hear the weird sounds coming from the mist?

*Misty Forest* is a text-based interactive mystery game created by **Julia Zhu, Mercury Li, Yanlin Chen and Cathy Cao**. It is built in Twine (SugarCube engine). The game simulates a real-time group chat interface where the player takes on the role of "User A," trapped in a deadly escape game with two other characters. The player must use deduction, gather clues from the dialogue, and make life-or-death choices to survive.

# Original Story

# Next Steps: LQA & Polish
1. **LQA (Language Quality Assurance)**: We will bring in native English speakers to review the translated text for tone, nuance, and cultural appropriateness.
2. **Multimedia Integration**: We plan to add a localizable opening scene and sound effects to enhance immersion and implement interaction mechanics beyond simple multiple-choice selections (e.g., player text input).
3. **Scalability**: The current framework is designed to be extensible. We hope to leverage this structure to localize the game into additional languages in the future.
